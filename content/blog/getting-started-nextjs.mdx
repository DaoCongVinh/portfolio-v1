# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this post, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several improvements:

- **App Router**: The new file-based routing system
- **Server Components**: Default server-side rendering for better performance
- **Improved TypeScript support**: Better type inference and error messages
- **Turbopack**: Faster build times with the new bundler

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the latest features.

## Key Concepts

### Server Components

Server Components are the default in Next.js 15. They run on the server and send only the necessary HTML to the client:

```jsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default function Page() {
  return <div>Hello from the server!</div>
}
```

### Client Components

For interactive components that need client-side JavaScript, use the `"use client"` directive:

```jsx
"use client"

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a powerful framework that makes building modern web applications easier than ever. Give it a try in your next project!
